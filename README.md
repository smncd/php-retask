PHP retask
==========

This is a PHP port of the [retask library](https://github.com/kushaldas/retask) written by Kushal Das.

retask is a lightweight libary used to create distributed task queues using Redis.

It is basically a wrapper on top of Redis's existing functionality, and meant to be compatible with the original retask Python module.

⚠️ At the moment this repo is a proof of concept and will probably change a fair bit, so use at your own risk, and have fun!
